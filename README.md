# Feature Development Workflow

## Adding a New Language:
  * [ ] To add a new language you will need to create another markdown file containing the new [acronym language:](http://sustainablesources.com/resources/country-abbreviations/)
    * E.g. `checklist-pt.md`.
  * [ ] No further approval will be necessary;
  * [ ] The new checklist language should be visible on Devckecklists after you saved the file on your forked repository.

## Important Notes:
  * [ ] Markdown is the only way to write checklists on Devchecklists;
  * [ ] For tips about how to use markdown to write checklists, please take a look at these raw files:
    * [ ] [`checklist-en.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vintasoftware/devchecklists-template/master/checklist-en.md) sample markdown;
    * [ ] [`README.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vintasoftware/devchecklists-template/master/README.md) contained on this repository;
    * [ ] Another checklists markdowns from [Devchecklists](https://devchecklists.com).
  * [ ] Changes on the checklist repository will reflect on the current checklist of Devchecklists.
